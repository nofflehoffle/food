Instructions
    1. Preperation

        Large pot with lid, medium high heat
        Paper towel and oil to coat pot
        When hot, add sausage and stir occasionally until sausage
            develops color (dark, not much black)
        Take out sausage and set on the side, do not clean pot, leave fond
        Add plenty of oil to pan until hot
        Add onions, celery, peppers -- generously salt and pepper
        Let vegetables cook down and use water that cooks out to scrape
            fond off bottom of pot
        When vegetables have softened, and started to brown (carrots still slightly firm)
            push to one side, add a drop of oil and garlic, wait 30 seconds
            stir together, generously add cajun seasoning, push back to side
        Add small oil to pot pour in rice and stir for 30 seconds to a minute
            to toast, stir back together
        Add tomatoes, and put sausage back in pot, stir

        Add more cajun seasoning, some chopped parsley -- keep extra parsley for finish
        Increase heat, stir occasionally until boiling, lower heat to a simmer
        Put on lid, stir occasionally, scraping bottom of pot until rice is done
            if stock has mostly been absorbed and rice isn't soft, add extra stock
        Food is finish, take off heat, make a plate, 
            finish with parsley, lime juice/yuzu kosho after plating 

Options
    Yuzu kosho, add before stock
    Lime juice, add with stock
    Chicken, salt and pepper, then brown before or after sausage, add back in with 
        sausage -- leave slightly undercooked, will finish while boiling
        or finish chicken and add back after the rest finishes cooking
            brine/marinade a couple hours or over night for better flavor
